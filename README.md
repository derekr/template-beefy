#### Easy circle avatars for your latest as-a-service app.

This is a really basic module to get you up and running w/ circle avatars because we 
all know circle avatars are super legit.

Simple add a `avatar` to a container class for the avatar img and you're rocking.

```html
<a href="/profile/drk" class="avatar">
    <img src="/avatars/drk.jpg" alt="drk avatar">
</a>
```

You can check out the various sizes by running:

```
npm install bubble-heads

Then add `node_modules/bubble-heads/lib/index.css` to your build script.

The choice is yours!
